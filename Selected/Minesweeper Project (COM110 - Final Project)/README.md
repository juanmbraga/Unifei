# Minesweeper

#### July 7, 2020

## Description
A simple Minesweper game written in C and given as the final assignment for the introductory subject on programming.

Note that a function to clear all adjacent clean areas wasn't made, therefore one should have in mind that it does not reflect the original experience in that sense.

## Experience
It was rather pleasant and enlightening to write a “larger scale” project. Most exercises on this first subject were small, which although are great to keep up at one’s own pace with the theory, does make some recommendations seen in the beginning of the subject seem distant – namely the importance of planning and properly thinking before starting to code, defining the structure and functioning of it, and considering modularization opportunities. 

Additionally, it made evident the value of variable standardization and code organization, as well as how much one can learn by teaching others.
