# COM111 - Algorithms and Data Structures
A subject that focuses on modularization of code along with the exercise of data abstraction (the combination of these two being basically the use of ADTs - Abstract data types) and software development with more awareness of memory.

Curiously, upon every new data structured I was presented with, the more I could see most of them as simple variations of a linked list (when not not considering the other, less emphasized, static structures). The pictures from the projects could be useful in better understanding them.

In sum, we were meant to learn the importance of the use of data structures as a form of efficient programming, indirectly instigating us to be more aware of memory when programming - which in turn may serve as a preparation for subjects on algorithm efficiency that will (hopefully) be studied in the next semester.

## Data Structure Library
A dream that did not come true (see second and third note below).

## Exercise Lists
Self explanatory. Lists that were given each week when a new data structure was presented.

## Projects
Projects (oh really!?) for which we had to produce code for a situation which the previously defined data structure would be relevant to. Although it wasn't absolutely necessary for the code to be entirely fitting (the focus was the document that had to contain what we learned on the sucject and the structure).

(See The Heterogeneous list project for an "inspired" text on the subject haha)

# A few notes  
- It was by the end of the semester that I started to realize that I was issuing a number of commits in github that was too high (realization also reinforced by some videos I would later watch). Since then I am commited to trying to reduce this number to a minimum.

- The exercise lists often have a large amount of functions and are like so due to it's purpose: modularization. Of course, the ideal situation would be to analyse a specific case and adapt most of the code to be as efficient as possible. That, however, would not be as practical and could potentially originate in (even more) bugs.

- It was for the previous point that I had decided to create code from scratch for each data structure, containing all variable names and commenting as clear as possible. Unfortunately due to my laptop dying I lost most of them (which took quite some time and effort to actually produce and review), and it now has only a struture (a Dynamic Pile).
