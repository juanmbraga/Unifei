# Unifei
This is meant to be a repository for (all) my exercises, assignments and projects from programming subjects at my university.

(I do not intento to worry myself with consistency, therefore some folders may have explanations or descriptions on the experience and others may not. Also, the written code may have variable names in portuguese, while README's will often be in english.)

# Folders

## Programming Fundamentals (COM110)
An introductory subject to the foundations and functioning of the C language, as wel as an overview of programming logic.

## Algorithms and Data Structures (COM111)
A subject that focuses on modularization of code along with the exercise of data abstraction (the combination of these two being basically the use of ADTs - Abstract data types) and software development with more awareness of memory. 

## Discrete maths - Cryptography Project
A short assignment that required us to develop a program to encrypt a small message in a way that can be reversed (I did not develop algorythm to reverse, though).

## Selected
This folder is meant to contain interesting projects and/or exercises, since there's probably going to be so many of them, including small, potentially unfinished and/or not-so-relevant stuff. 
    
# Credits 
 
### COM110
All Pdf's belong to my professor Melise Maria Veiga de Paula, and are available with her consent (though I asked only to add it to github, I suppose it wouldn't be open to distribution without contacting her and/or giving credits).

### COM111 
All exercises were given by our professor [Elisa de Cassia Silva Rodrigues](https://github.com/elisa-rodrigues), which have used some textbooks as reference (the reference material will be specified in the README file, when applicable).

*Additional individual credits were added to the respective exercises or projects.*
