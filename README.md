# Unifei
 Exercises, assignments and projects from programming subjects, on the Computer Science course at the Federal University of Itajuba (UNIFEI), in 2020.

Each folder represents a subject from uni. 

The folder "Selected" (work in progress) contains selected projects and/or exercises which I think may be useful to see my progress (and besides, theres loads of exercises and perhaps random stuff, so that makes things easier without removing the backup of everything else
)
# A few notes:
All of the comments and content are in portuguese, with a few exceptions where english words have been used as variable names.

[Done] after the folder name implies the exercises have been finished.
