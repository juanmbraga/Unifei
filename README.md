# Unifei

This is meant to be a repository for my exercises, assignments and projects from subjects on programming at my university.

# Notes

- On the number of commits
- On the amount of functions used in COM111
- On arrays of lists ofr automation
- Dynamic Data Structures as variations of a simple linked list

# Folders

## Programming Fundamentals (COM110)
An introductory subject to the foundations and functioning of the C language, as wel as an overview of programming logic.

## Algorithms and Data Structures (COM111)
A subject that focuses on modularization of code along with the exercise of data abstraction (the combination of these two being basically the use of ADTs - Abstract data types) and software development with more awareness of memory. 

Currently taking the course. Will write more at the end of year. 

## Discrete maths - Cryptography Project
A short assignment that required us to develop a way to encrypt a small message in a way that can be reversed (I did not develop the reverse algorythm though).

## Selected
This folder is meant to contain interesting projects and/or exercises, since there's probably going to be so many small and not-so-relevant ones. 
    
# Credits 
 
### COM110
All Pdf's belong to my professor Melise Maria Veiga de Paula, and are available with her consent (though I asked only to add it to github, I suppose it wouldn't be open to distribution without contacting her and/or giving credits).

### COM111 
All exercises were given by our professor [Elisa de Cassia Silva Rodrigues](https://github.com/elisa-rodrigues), which have used some textbooks as a reference (the reference material will be specified in the README file, when applicable).

*Additional individual credits were added to the respective exercises or projects.*
