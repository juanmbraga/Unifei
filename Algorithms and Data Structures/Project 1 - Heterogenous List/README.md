# Homogeneous list of heterogeneous objects
#### September 21, 2020
## Short description
Developed in the second semester after we had seen the fundamentals for, as well as some examples of, data structures. 

It was meant for the students to look up on the literature and internet about the concept that was assigned to them (list can be found in the pdf **"Modulo 07 - Trabalho Pratico 01 - Proposta.pdf"**, in Portuguese).

My group received the theme "Homogeneous list of Heterogeneous Objects", and after some deliberation on the difficulties of the concept (or rather, the amount of time that the ADT - Abstract Data Type, would take) we decided to make a simple list that contained the data of different geometric shapes, and calculated their volume. 

## A few noteworthy points
The code was made based on the teacher's already available implementation of a simple linked list, and I believe that may have caused it to be a little more bloated due to us adapting it and not keeping only the perhaps more relevant functions. 

Furthermore, one could point out a lack of standardization of the variable and function names, which does gives me some _itches_ (specially variable names with single or two letters, and functions with multiple structures, such as openFolder, open_folder, and openfolder). The project could have used some more planning at the beginning and could progress more organically if the code were made from the ground up. 

We also made a presentation, of which I was assigned the task of making an introduction as well as explaining the concept itself. The pdf with the presentation slides can be found on this folder by the name of **"Modulo 07 - Trabalho Pratico 01 - Lista Heterogenea (Slides Introducao).pdf"**. Since I have not asked the others for consent, I did not upload it. 

## On the concept of Heterogeneous Lists
I had been very interested in ways of explaining concepts since the beginning of the year when I watched a few CS50 classes from Harvard University on EdX. I was fascinated by how David Malan cares about how people understand concepts (or at least that is what I presumed based on his excellent classes) and applies that awareness on his examples and practical situations. 

After having found such a small amount of resources on this specific topic, other than a short pdf from Unicamp (University of Campinas), and gaining a little excitement by my professor's positive feedback on the project and a wish of re-making the video explanation with a better description of the supermarket example; after all that I decided to try and write about the subject in the clearest way I could. It is on the markdown file called **"On the concept of Heterogeneous Lists"**.
